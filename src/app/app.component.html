{{ myType?.abc }}


<p>
  Currently, the app should build. Running ng serve, follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Change the MyType interfaces property to be abcd instead of abc. The re-build will pick up the type error in the above template expression.
  </li>
  <li>
    Change the MyType interfaces property back to abc. The re-build will still report the type error when it should not.
  </li>
</ol>
